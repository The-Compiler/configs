# vim: ft=text

This Repository contains some of my config files for the applications
I'm using, aka dotfiles.

Usually, you need to prepend a dot to them. I keep the git repo in
~/.config-git and symlink my configfiles to there, which works fine, except
with easystroke.

If not specified otherwise in the files itself:
